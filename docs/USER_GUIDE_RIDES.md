# How Your Rides Are Verified - Komornicka 100

This guide explains how your Strava activities are verified for the Komornicka 100 challenge, including what makes a valid ride, how the verification process works, and how to troubleshoot any issues.

## How Verification Works

When you connect your Strava account to Komornicka 100, our system automatically checks your bike rides to determine if they match our official routes. Here's what happens behind the scenes:

### 1. Activity Discovery

- Our system checks your Strava account every few hours for new bike rides
- We only process activities marked as "Ride" type in Strava
- Public activities are processed automatically (private or followers-only activities cannot be verified)

### 2. Route Matching

For each new ride, we analyze:

- GPS coordinates from your Strava activity
- Comparison with our official route GPX files
- The percentage of your ride that matches the official route
- The total distance of your activity

### 3. Verification Decision

Based on our analysis, your ride will either:

- Be **approved** if it meets all criteria (you'll receive an email confirmation)
- Not be approved if it doesn't match our criteria (no notification sent)

### 4. Leaderboard Update

Once approved:
- Your activity count increases on the leaderboard
- Your ride is added to your profile's verified activities
- You'll be notified by email about the successful verification

## Requirements for Valid Rides

For your ride to be successfully verified, it must meet ALL of these criteria:

### Activity Settings

- Recorded as a "Ride" activity type in Strava (not Run, Walk, etc.)
- Set to "Everyone" (public) visibility in Strava privacy settings
- Uploaded to Strava as a single, continuous activity

### Route and Distance

- Follow one of our predefined routes closely
- Have at least 80% of GPS points match within 20 meters of the official route
- Be at least 95 kilometers in total distance
- Not exceed 24 hours in duration

### Authenticity

- Be a genuine GPS recording (not manually created or edited)
- Show natural GPS variations (extremely perfect matches may be flagged)
- Not be a duplicate of another ride you've already submitted

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I ride the routes in either direction?

**Yes.** Our verification system recognizes routes ridden in either direction.

### Can I start and finish at any point on the route?

**Yes.** You can begin and end your ride anywhere along the official route, as long as you complete the entire loop.

### How closely do I need to follow the route?

You need to follow the route closely enough that at least 80% of your GPS points are within 20 meters of the official route. Small detours (for road construction, etc.) are usually acceptable as long as you rejoin the route promptly.

### What if I need to make a brief stop during my ride?

Brief stops (for rest, water, etc.) are fine. Just keep recording your activity in Strava rather than stopping and restarting the recording.

### Can I submit the same route multiple times?

**Yes!** You can ride and submit the same route as many times as you want. Each properly verified ride counts separately toward your total.

### What if I record the same ride twice by accident?

If you accidentally record the same ride with multiple devices (for example, with your phone and a GPS computer), our system will detect this as a duplicate. We'll count the recording with the best quality match and ignore the others.

### Why wasn't my ride verified?

Common reasons include:

- **Route Mismatch**: Your ride didn't follow the official route closely enough
- **Distance Too Short**: Your ride was less than 95 kilometers
- **Privacy Settings**: Your Strava activity was set to private or followers-only
- **Activity Type**: The activity was not set to "Ride" in Strava
- **GPS Issues**: Significant GPS errors or gaps in recording
- **Duplicate Activity**: The ride was already counted from another recording

### How long does verification take?

Our system checks for new activities every few hours between 6:00 AM and 10:00 PM. Once your ride is found, verification usually happens within minutes.

## Tips for Successful Verification

Follow these tips to ensure your rides are verified successfully:

### Before Your Ride

1. **Check your Strava settings** to ensure you're set up to record "Ride" activities
2. **Make sure GPS is enabled** and functioning on your recording device
3. **Start with a fully charged device** for longer rides
4. **View the official route** on our website before starting
5. **Download the route** to your GPS device or phone for guidance

### During Your Ride

1. **Follow the official route** as closely as possible
2. **Keep recording even during breaks** - don't stop and restart your activity
3. **Check your GPS is working** periodically during your ride
4. **Complete the entire route** - shortcuts will result in non-verification

### After Your Ride

1. **Upload your activity to Strava** promptly
2. **Set visibility to "Everyone"** (public) in Strava
3. **Don't edit the GPS data** after uploading
4. **Ensure activity type is "Ride"** in Strava settings
5. **Wait a few hours** for our system to verify your activity

## Troubleshooting Verification Issues

### Check Your Strava Settings

1. **Confirm activity visibility**: Go to the activity in Strava → Edit → Privacy Controls → set to "Everyone"
2. **Verify activity type**: Go to the activity in Strava → Edit → Sport Type → select "Ride"

### Check Your Route Match

1. View your ride on Strava and compare it with our official route
2. See if there are sections where you deviated significantly from the route
3. Check for GPS jumps or errors that might affect verification

### Common GPS Issues

- **Poor GPS reception** in forests, urban canyons, or bad weather
- **Device going to sleep** during breaks (preventing continuous recording)
- **Low battery** causing GPS recording to stop or become inaccurate
- **Phone in pocket** resulting in poor GPS signal

### Activity Not Found After 24 Hours

If your activity hasn't been verified after 24 hours:

1. Make sure your Strava account is still connected to Komornicka 100
2. Check that the activity is public and set as "Ride" type 
3. Verify that you completed the full route by comparing with our official GPX
4. Contact support for assistance
